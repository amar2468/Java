The program is a search engine which allows the user to input a term or terms and the program tells the user how many times this word occurs and in which files. 

The program consists of four classes:
1. FileProcessing class, which takes the file and compare each word in the file with the terms entered
2. SearchEngine class, which is a GUI class that allows user to enter the word in a text field and allows the user to click a button that checks whether the word occurs in the files.
3. ShowingFiles class, which shows the contents of the files that were chosen by the user
4. Control class, which creates a search engine object that gives the title to the app
